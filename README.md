- Currently building custom CMSs and HTTP APIs at [TTI](https://www.ttigroup.com) as a backend Elixir programmer on the Torque Interactive team.

- On the side, building [ExIntegrate](https://github.com/samrose/ex_integrate), an automated CI server written in Elixir

- Currently learning about automated CI servers, runtime analysis, and Phoenix LiveView

- I value well-written, well-tested code and teams that prioritize agile practices

- When I'm not programming, you can find me composing
  [music](https://soundcloud.com/garrettmichaelgeorge) for the concert hall,
  spending time with my wife, hitting the disc golf course with friends, and playing tug with my dog, Pippin.
